# Hudson's Portfolio Website

## What Is This? Why Is It a Thing?

This is a portfolio website developed by me, Hudson "HuddyP" [REDACTED] as a way of teaching myself the Angular framework and creating a webpage to advertise myself and the projects that I've done.
I wanted to create it as a way of adding some flair to how I present myself to employers and to keep a personal history of what I've done as a developer

## How Did You Build This?

With blood, sweat, tears, HTML, CSS, TypeScript and the Angular framework

## Are You Going to Maintain This?

The website should stay up as long as GitHub Pages is a supported feature of the site. I'm also open to adding and tweaking aspects of the site as time goes on and I become more experienced with web development.
I recognize that the site is likely amateurish at best in its current state, but I would like to make it better over time.
