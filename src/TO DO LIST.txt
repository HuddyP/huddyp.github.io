TO DO LIST:

Site Features:
- look into extra features to implement to make site more impressive
- Adding animations to aspects of pages (hover animation for headshot and other pictures, smooth scrolling for different parts of pages, etc.)
    - "make" CSS animations using Animista website (animsta.net)

Visual Flair + Personal Advertising:

- remove default navbar page css (don't need to do anything wild, just make it *not* the default)
- dig into CSS and visual design from there (good color scheme, unique but readable font)
- Add more "professional" type photos to spread throughout site (not necessarily same type as the headshot, but stuff like the cornfield pictures)
- add "hover" animations to images such as headshot, to give more responsiveness and visual flair


Ideas to Consider Implementing:

- Make Projects page have some type of embed to give extra flair to showing off projects
    - try making a tab system that lets me have multiple images to click through and an embedded link underneath
